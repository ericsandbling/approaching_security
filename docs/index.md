# Approaching Security

This is a project aiming at developing a generic approach to security when endeavoring to develop a system, any system.

## Introduction

### Hypothesis

The seminal hypothesis for this project is that security when designing a system is mainly accidental and generally only as good as the amount of attention by the developers of the system.

To address this an algorithm should be possible to design, allowing the designers to make informed decisions about security as well as facilitating an empirically supported confidence in the security of the system.
